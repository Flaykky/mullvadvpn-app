- Added support for multihop which allows routing traffic through an entry location to an exit location.
- Added support for using DAITA with locations lacking DAITA support by automatically routing the traffic via a DAITA enabled location. This behaviour can be disabled using the "Direct only" setting.
- Updated DAITA to v2 which supports dynamic configurations provided by relays.
- Improved how the app detects whether routes are available in order to reduce potential leaks.
- Minimized calls to re-establish the VPN tunnel, since this may cause Android to leak some traffic.
